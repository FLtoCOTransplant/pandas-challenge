# pandas-challenge

This weeks homework is a choose your own adventure.  Analyzing a fantasy game sounds more interestint to me than
analyzing school test scores considering the current situation due to Covid-19, so I have chosen to look into
the Heroes of Pymoli.  What is the make up of the players of Heroes of Pymoli?  That is the goal of this
excersize...to come up with three trends.

To come up with these three trends I will look at the following

- total # of players

- What did those players purchase

- What is the gender & age makeup of the players

- Who are the top spenders and what are the most popular items

- What are the most profitable items
